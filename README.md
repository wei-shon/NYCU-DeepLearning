# NYCU-DeepLearning
My course grade is not good at all, so you can take a look. I suggest you can write the program by youself.

## LAB01
We will do the backpropagation and forward propagation by Numpy (Python lib) in this lab. Before starting to do this lab, I go to understand the derivative of loss function and chain rule which are used to do backpropagation. And then I use a class to package all the function we need, and then build two models which are Linear model and Xor model. Finally, we can get two high accuracy models after we train those. 

## LAB02
In this lab, we will do TD-learning in the 2048 game. We will finish TO-DO function so that it can work better

## LAB03
In this lab, we will implement the EEG classification that is EEGNet and DeepConvNet. Moreover, we will change the inside activation function with ReLU, LeakyReLU, and ELU. To see which combination will be the best model with highest accuracy.

## LAB04
In this lab, we will implement the image classification that is ResNet18 and ResNet50. Moreover, we will preprocess data by ourselves and using pre-Trained model. To see which models will be the best model with highest accuracy.

## LAB05
In this lab, we will implement the video prediction with Conditional VAE. Moreover, we will use teacher forcing and KL annealing to make model become better. Finally, we make predict image to GIF and see the robotâ€™s arm will move to where.

## LAB06
DQN and DDPG

## LAB07
This Lab we will implement the conditional DDPM model to solve the problem that given condition and noise image to create the image that fit to the given condition.
