# NYCU-DeepLearning

## LAB01
We will do the backpropagation and forward propagation by Numpy (Python lib) in this lab. Before starting to do this lab, I go to understand the derivative of loss function and chain rule which are used to do backpropagation. And then I use a class to package all the function we need, and then build two models which are Linear model and Xor model. Finally, we can get two high accuracy models after we train those. 

## LAB02
In this lab, we will do TD-learning in the 2048 game. We will finish TO-DO function so that it can work better

## LAB03
In this lab, we will implement the EEG classification that is EEGNet and DeepConvNet. Moreover, we will change the inside activation function with ReLU, LeakyReLU, and ELU. To see which combination will be the best model with highest accuracy.

## LAB04
In this lab, we will implement the image classification that is ResNet18 and ResNet50. Moreover, we will preprocess data by ourselves and using pre-Trained model. To see which models will be the best model with highest accuracy.
