# NYCU-DeepLearning

## LAB01

## LAB02
In this lab, we will do TD-learning in the 2048 game. We will finish TO-DO function so that it can work better

## LAB03
In this lab, we will implement the EEG classification that is EEGNet and DeepConvNet. Moreover, we will change the inside activation function with ReLU, LeakyReLU, and ELU. To see which combination will be the best model with highest accuracy.

## LAB04
In this lab, we will implement the image classification that is ResNet18 and ResNet50. Moreover, we will preprocess data by ourselves and using pre-Trained model. To see which models will be the best model with highest accuracy.
